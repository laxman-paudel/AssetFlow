# How to Host Your Application for Free

This guide will walk you through deploying your Next.js application to the internet for free using **Vercel**. Vercel is the company that created Next.js, and their hosting platform is perfectly optimized for it.

The whole process is fast and should only take you about 5-10 minutes.

### Step 1: Push Your Project to GitHub

Before you can host your site, the code needs to be in an online code repository. The most popular choice is GitHub.

1.  **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't have one already, sign up for a free account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

2.  **Create a New Repository:**
    *   On your GitHub dashboard, click the "**+**" icon in the top-right corner and select "**New repository**".
    *   Give your repository a name (e.g., `assetflow-app`).
    *   You can make it **Public** or **Private** (Vercel works with both).
    *   Click "**Create repository**".

3.  **Upload Your Code:**
    *   After creating the repository, you will see a page with instructions. The easiest way to upload your project is to use the "**...or upload an existing folder**" link on that page.
    *   Drag and drop your entire project folder into the browser window.
    *   Once the files are uploaded, click "**Commit changes**".

### Step 2: Sign Up for Vercel and Connect Your Project

Now you will connect Vercel to your GitHub repository.

1.  **Create a Vercel Account:**
    *   Go to [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup).
    *   Choose "**Continue with GitHub**" and authorize Vercel to access your account. This is secure and standard practice.

2.  **Import Your Project:**
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click "**Add New...**" and select "**Project**".
    *   You will see a list of your GitHub repositories. Find your newly created `assetflow-app` repository and click the "**Import**" button next to it.

3.  **Deploy Your Application:**
    *   Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Next.js project and pre-fill all the necessary settings. You don't need to change anything.
    *   Simply click the "**Deploy**" button.

### Step 3: All Done!

That's it! Vercel will now build your application and deploy it to its global network. The process usually takes about 1-2 minutes.

Once it's finished, you will be given a public URL (like `assetflow-app.vercel.app`) where you can see your live application.

**Best of all, every time you push new changes to your GitHub repository's main branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy your site with the latest updates.**
